# Basic app to download music from youtube

## Still in development, new features will eventually be added
Do not hesitate to ask for features, make suggestions or pull requests.

## Please Help

I am ultimately planning on putting a protection so you cannot download unsupported urls. 
For the time, if you see any youtube url that is not working (for example `https://www.youtube.com`), please put a response to <a href='https://github.com/Laggrif/Youtube_Download/issues/1'>this issue</a> with the url and I will add them to the blacklist as soon as possible


This project make use of <a href='https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp'>yt-dlp</a> and <a href='https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python'>Pyside6</a>.
